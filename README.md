In order to facilitate the efficient computation of the Jacobian matrix for the velocity vector, essential for determining the torque requirements of our designed motor, we have developed a Python script leveraging the robotics-toolbox library, specifically the one maintained by Peter Corke.Our implementation involves the utilization of the inverse kinematics solver (IK solver) within the library. This solver facilitates the extraction of the Jacobian matrix by specifying the joint types and initializing various arm parameters. The arm class is instantiated with these parameters, and subsequently, the solver is employed to obtain the desired Jacobian matrix.To streamline this process, we have meticulously declared the joint types and initialized the relevant parameters for the robotic arm. This information is then supplied to the IK solver, which, in turn, yields the Jacobian matrix.With the obtained Jacobian matrix, we can conduct a thorough analysis to ascertain the maximum torque requirements imposed on the motor. This professionalized approach ensures precision and clarity in the calculation of torque, contributing to the robustness and reliability of our motor design.
